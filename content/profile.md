Software engineer in Tokyo.

### Career Summary
I learned computer science at electronics engineering and computer science department, Fukuoka university.

There are some reasons for me to prefer the bank to a web company.

I worked for a small web company, Rarejob, inc and now working for piece of cake, inc.
