## About me

- Name: Inoue Taishi (井上太志)
- Birth: 1986/08/23
- Address: Tokyo

Software engineer in Tokyo.

I learned computer science at university.
After that, I started my career in banking as bank clerk(it's not software engineer. I was interested in finance at that time)

I quitted the bank company in 1 year to help my father's business(cause my father has a disease).
I managed the business instead of my father for 3 years.

However this business was closed unfortunately.
Then I restarted my career as a software engineer in 2012.

Now I have experienced over 6 years of experience as a software engineer.
1 small company(5 employees), 1 listed company(more than 100 employees) and a startup company.

I love to design software, solve problems and give good experience through the web to users.

The most important thing to build great software for me is teamwork.
I interested in team management as well.
Always thinking what I should do to enhance the team output.
